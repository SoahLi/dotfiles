# Matrix Morpheus GRUB Theme
**Red Pill vs Blue Pill**

A minimalist Matrix-inspired GRUB theme featuring full-screen dynamic backgrounds that change between Linux and Windows.

---

**Note:**  
Currently, the theme only includes the **Arch Linux** and **Windows** icons.  
 
Also, while the icons are **arranged horizontally** on screen,  
you still navigate using the **Up** and **Down arrow keys** as in a normal GRUB menu.

Optional: Simplify Your GRUB Menu

I designed this theme for a two entry layout and haven't really thought about how to visually handle the additional entries. 

If your GRUB menu currently has extra entries such as:

- “Advanced options for Arch Linux”
- “UEFI Firmware Settings”

I would recommend you remove the extra menu entries from the grub config if you don't use them.
